# Practicing-Postman-API
Assignment22 for homework on IT Bootcamp course

API requests in Postman:

- Follow the instructions from the link.

For starters, you have to register, but you can use any non-existent email.

In postman itself:
Create a collection called Assignment22
The first request is List Books with query parameters limit 3
Make the other requests from the link yourself and try order all actions
For order you have to be logged in, there use Authorization and token that you get when registering (save token as a global variable, and then use it for further requests).

Additionally, you can store the url and token in variables at the collection level.

Query parameters are as follows (bolded)
http://url.com?key=value&key2=value2"
And you can set it in Postman without writing in the url, but in the Parameters "tab", to the left of Authorization.

Use the Authorization tab for what it says Bearer Token, for requests where you have to be logged in.

Homework is submitted by doing export collection
